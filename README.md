# ShellSpy

The following is my attempt at the following set of exercises: https://github.com/bitfield/shellspy

The goal of this small project is to get more familiar with working in the TDD flow using Golang.

## Description

The aim of this project is to produce a Go library package and accompanying command-line tool that will record a user's shell session to a text file, like a simple version of the Unix [`script`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/script.1.html) command.

## Goals

- Get more familiar with writing tests in Go. Keep testing behaviours top of mind
- Create a package that is able to be imported by an external user to use within their project
- Get comfortable using more of Golang's syntax and contructs to build a small program
